  title: 'Path Engineering: Causal Manipulation of the "Road Not Taken"'
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Artificially constraining the model''s path space by reducing the dimensionality
    of hidden representations along critical directions will decrease uncertainty,
    while expanding the path space will increase uncertainty, even when the reasoning
    problem itself remains unchanged.

    '
  background:
    description: 'We''ll test whether the correlation between uncertainty and path
      representation is causal by artificially creating or destroying alternate paths
      in the model''s representation space. If the core paper is right, we should
      see uncertainty change accordingly when we engineer the path landscape.
